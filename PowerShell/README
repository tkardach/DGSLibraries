Certificate Scanner

Goal: 
  Check all active ports on a remote server for a bound certificate.

Process: 

  1. User signs in using PSCredentials
  2. Script signs into a server and retrieves all IPs (ipconfig \all will even grab IPs not
  registered with DNS) and all active ports (netstat -na)
  3. Script then checks each all ports on all IP addresses and saves all certificates found
